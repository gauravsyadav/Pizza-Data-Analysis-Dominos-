Overview: 
The primary goal of this project was to analyze pizza consumption patterns and revenue generation to provide insights that can drive business decisions for the pizza company.
The dataset consists of 4 tables having various data regarding pizza sale. It contains various data like pizza types, orders, order details and pizza details.

Steps: 
1.) Data Collection (Web scraping & cleaning with Python): I have used various python libraries like Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Selenium etc. to scrape the data and stored it into a tabular format like csv or excel.
2.) Created Database Schema (With SQL queries): I have used SQL queries to create database schema and then imported scraped data into the same schema.
3.) EDA (With SQL queries): I have performed EDA with the help of SQL queries. We have used SQL queries to filter, group, aggregate, and manipulate the data to find meaningful insights.
4.) ETL & Visualization (Power BI Dashboard): I have connected Power BI to SQL database and performed ETL (Extract Transform Load) on the dataset. I have used Power BI features like charts, graphs, cards, slicers, DAX functions and other features to create an interactive dashboard.

TechStack:
•	Python 
•	SQL 
•	Power BI

Insights:
1.) Quarterly revenue: 
As per this analysis it is observed that quarter 1 least revenue around 12.3 million and quarter 4 has made the highest revenue around 12.6 million.
2.) Top 10 most ordered pizza types by quantity:
In this analysis I have observed that Chicken sausage has been ordered the most in quantity among the other pizza types and blazing chicken & paprika has been ordered the least among the top 10.
3.) Top 3 most ordered pizza by revenue:
As per the analysis Chicken sausage has made the highest revenue, Fiery sausage & paprika has made the second highest revenue and blazing onion & paprika has made the third highest revenue.
4.) Distribution of orders according to pizza sizes:
After analyzing this it is observed that medium size pizza has been ordered the most and then second most preferable size is small and then large.

5.) Orders placed on hourly basis:
In this analysis most pizza orders have been placed around 3 p.m. and between 7 pm to 8 pm. And the least orders have been made around 12 to 1 pm, 4 pm and 9 pm.
6.) Each pizza percentage contribution to total revenue:
As per the analysis Chicken sausage has the highest revenue contribution to total revenue and roasted chicken wings peri-peri has made the lowest revenue contribution to total revenue.

Conclusion:
This project successfully analyzed pizza consumption patterns and revenue generation. Key insights include:
1.	Quarterly Revenue: Highest in Q4, lowest in Q1.
2.	Top Ordered Pizzas: Chicken Sausage is the most ordered and highest revenue-generating pizza.
3.	Order Sizes: Medium pizzas are the most popular.
4.	Peak Order Times: Around 3 p.m. and 7-8 p.m.
